# Maze-game
🚀 Welcome to my first game development project, powered by Greenfoot libraries! 🎮

During my 10th-grade year, I embarked on an exhilarating journey into the realm of programming and game development. Today, I'm thrilled to present my debut game, an exciting maze-navigating adventure where players munch on food to boost speed while dodging enemies en route to the endpoints.

🕹️ Gameplay Highlights:

Maze Navigation: Engage in thrilling maze exploration, seeking out pathways to victory.
Speed Boosts: Gobble up food items to increase your speed, adding an extra layer of excitement.
Enemy Evasion: Dodge and outmaneuver enemies lurking in the maze, enhancing the challenge.
Goal-Oriented: Reach the endpoints to progress through levels and conquer new challenges.
Massive gratitude to Greenfoot for providing an exceptional platform that empowered me to bring my game development dreams to life! 🙌
